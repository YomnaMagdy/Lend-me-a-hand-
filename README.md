Motivation :

     Due to the current pandemic, many lecturers and tutors
    resolved to giving online or recorded classes. Many of
    which require illustrations to be used as visual aid
    alongside the tutor himself. Adding these illustrations
    can be difficult for some people.

Goals :

     The aim of our project is to provide an easy way to
    record and draw illustrations simultaneously. Using
    real-time hand tracking, you can now draw anything on
    the screen while you’re explaining. You can also draw
    words and they will be converted to regular text.
    Strategy 

The project will be implemented using PYTHOpenCV , It will
be divided into four parts:

    ▪ GUI : A desktop application will be made for interactions so that the program would be userfriendly.

    ▪ Hand-Detection : The program will start drawing depending on the position of the finger, so a hand detection phase must occur.

    ▪ Adding The Colors : After detecting the fingers’ position, a brush will follow the finger to commence drawing.

    ▪ Converting To Text : Upon request, the app will consider the drawing as words and will start converting it to text.
